Hi, I’m Giorgos 👋

IT Technician based in Greece 🇬🇷, into computer & network security and I like building practical, lightweight tools for Windows.

Most of what I share here is made for real world troubleshooting: small utilities, dashboards, and automation scripts. I prefer projects that are portable, straightforward, and don’t need a huge setup just to be useful.

I’m also into open-source — I like sharing code, learning in public, and contributing when I can.
