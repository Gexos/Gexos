# Hi, I’m Giorgos 👋

IT Technician based in Greece 🇬🇷 — into **computer & network security**, and I like building **practical, lightweight Windows tools**.

Most of what I share is made for real-world troubleshooting: small utilities, dashboards, and automation scripts. I prefer projects that are **portable**, **straightforward**, and don’t need a huge setup just to be useful.
